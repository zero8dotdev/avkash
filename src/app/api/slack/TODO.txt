[slack issues]

1. In showing the number of leaves the number is coming as undefined
2. Need the slack channels of the organization where they want to post messages to everyone like when someone is going on leave then it should notify everyone.
3. Need discussion on leaveTypes and leavePolicies, how to calculate them.


change avkash to avkash.io in slack app
your team past 7 'days' leaves
auto select the team--> in add leave
auto select the current user--> add leave
notes should be optional
